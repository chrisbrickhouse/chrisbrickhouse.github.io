Astute readers will notice the solid year gap between this and the last post. Turns out that with the pandemic and multiple moves I forgot that I had set this up. Well, wait no more: I've updated most every part of the site. As of writing, I'm still working on embedding PDFs [for my cv page](/cv), cataloging my software contributions at [my software page](/software), adding some long-form citations to various pages, and in the long term I need some new headshots so that I can decorate the site with pictures of my face. I'll try to update the blog more often, probably with content that's too long for twitter. We'll see how that goes.
