A short post, but exciting still! I'm excited to start on a new outreach project, *The Language Lab*, a YouTube channel 
which will cover cutting-edge linguistics research for general audiences. Using creative non-fiction, multi-media demonstrations, and
expert interviews, *The Language Lab* will invite viewers to explore the frontiers of linguistic science and learn about the ideas and 
passions which go into knowledge creation.

The project is still in its planning phase, but I'm excited for the support I've already received! The [*Lingthusiasm* podcast](https://lingthusiasm.com/) has 
offered a grant for start-up costs, and [Emily Remirez](https://sites.google.com/berkeley.edu/eremirez/) is working on branding. I've been 
talking with [Kevin McGowan](https://kbmcgowan.github.io/) and [Zion Mengesha](https://www.zionmengesha.com/) about their work to prepare 
some early videos. I'm looking forward to working with more people and sharing the amazing work being done with the world!

A lot of my inspiration comes from [*Numberphile*](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCoxcjq-8xIDTYp3uz647V5A) and [Adam Ragusea](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9_p50tH3WmMslWRWKnM7dQ), 
two channels that I really enjoy. While they often deal with complex topics and questions, they work hard to engage the audience by sharing a researcher's passion and 
bringing us along for the ride. We all got into linguistics because it is interesting, and while the specific questions can become 
pretty complex, the same curiosity that led us there can lead others there too. There's a lot of work still to do, but I look forward to more updates on what's to come!
