Now that my proposal has been sent off to the committee, I finally had time to finish the bits I talked about in [my last post](/weblog/2021/08/26/website-redone-reprise.html). Have a look! You can [see my CV](/cv) as an embedded PDF and read [a list of my software contributions](/software). I also fixed some links in the previous post that gave 404 errors.
