After a number of years of my old website, I've revamped it to not only be easier for visitors, but easier for me to maintain. 
It uses Jekyll on Github and was created using [a guide](http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/) by Jonathan McGlone. If you're looking for a way to update your website easily, I recommend reading through it as it's geared towards people who may not be familiar with continuous integration practices.
