I've been making open source contributions for a while in a lot of different places, so I can't point you to an exhaustive list of my software.

- [My main portfolio is on GitHub](https://github.com/chrisbrickhouse) and the pinned repos represent some of my best and most recent work.
- For my Wikimedia stuff: I have a list of periodically running, [server-side processes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:WugBot) and a list of standalone [client-side applications](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Wugapodes/Tech_stuff)
