Below are various software projects I am working on or have worked on alongside the software license and langauges used. All entries are linked to a documentation page that has more detailed information on the software. This is not an exhaustive list as I only included entries that might be useful for others, so particular experimental designs or analysis scripts are omitted. An exhaustive list can be found on [my GitHub repositories tab](https://github.com/chrisbrickhouse?tab=repositories).

To summarize below, my favorite license is the GNU General Public License version 3, and I am proficient in Python, R, JavaScript, PHP, HTML, and CSS with minor abilities in other languages. I'm also good at bash scripting but that's largely for my own personal use as I'm a long-time user of linux and have had to learn to fix my machine many times over the years.
