## Dissertation work (Embodying the Lexicon)
My dissertation work investigates the implications of exemplar-based theories of word recognition and how these can inform
sociolinguistic theories of embodiment. Exemplar-based models hypothesize that memories of linguistic experiences are detailed 
and can store more than just the linguistic signal. While strong versions of the theory would predict that all information is 
retained, evidence suggests that what gets retain is in fact filtered to some degree. For example, Bradlow, et al., (1999) 
found that listeners remembered words better when they were spoken in the same voice or at the same speaking rate, but not 
when spoken at the same amplitude (loudness). However listeners were able to notice the difference in loudness when asked,
suggesting that not all information is retained. Sommers & Barcroft (2006) theorized that only information useful for
interpreting the phonetic signal was remembered, but this proved too restrictive. Pufahl & Samuel (2014) found that listeners 
retain contextual noises such as dog barks and phone rings, and performance on later word recognition tasks was worse if the 
irrelevant contextual noises were removed. While linguistic memories are selective, they are not so selective that context 
like dogs barking is filtered out.

So where are the edges? Clearly *acoustic* context is taken into account, and this makes sense given the oral languages 
being tested. But people use language in a variety of contexts rich with sights, smells, tastes, and touch. Acoustic context
alone is still quite narrow, but it implies these other sensory modes may be incorporated into linguistic memories as well.
Research has shown convincingly that visual context is taken into account. Johnson, et al., (1999) showed that visual cues 
to gender can affect perceptual boundaries between vowels. Koops, et al., (2008) and Rubin (1992) showed that processing 
can be impaired when visual information does not match phonetically cued social variation. Conversely, processing can be 
facilitated when visual information and phonetic cues are aligned (McGowan, 2011; Szakay et al., 2012). I'm unaware of 
studies into smell or taste with regards to speech perception, and while touch, as it relates to proprioception of the 
articulators, has been studied in the context of motor theories of speech perception, we feel more than just our mouths 
when we converse. Goldinger & Hansen (2005) showed that physical sensation (a vibrating chair) can facilitate recall of
written words and other visual stimuli, but how this relates to spoken word recognition is an open question.

I'm particularly interested in the haptic (touch) components of linguistic memories given its relation to emerging 
sociolinguistic theories of embodiment. Broadly, embodied argues that cultures produce corporeal restrictions and that when
an individual enters into these spaces, their actions are negotiated within the context of these prexisting bodily
practices (Butler, 1988). As an example, tattoos are a way of embodying particular cultural symbols of personal or communal
significance. The cultural pressure to acquire (or avoid) a tattoo is a corporeal restriction, and individuals--rather than
making decision completely independently--negotiate their choice to get a tattoo in the context of this pre-existing social
norm. Within sociolinguistics, this theory has been extended to incorporate the ways in which language is produced by bodies.
The corporeal restrictions imposed on bodies within a cultural context affect the same bodies that produce and perceive 
language. With this in mind, Pratt & D'Onofrio (2017) present the interesting question: what is the role of the body in 
sound change?

My dissertation work plans to connect these two theoretical lines of reasoning by demonstrating the role of haptic context
in linguistic processing. While previous work on linguistic embodiment has focused on the causal relationship between posture
and articulation, the broader theory of embodied social practice predicts that listeners are also embodying social roles
and that this embodiment affects the way a listener interacts with and interprets the world. As patterns of practice, the
theory implicates patterns of exposure to particular word forms, accents, and language variation. If these embodied social 
practices are remembered alongised linguistic events, then we should see recognition improve when embodied contexts and 
linguistic forms align. Whether these predictions hold true will help motivate further theory in speech perception and
sociolinguistics.

## Voices of California
The [Voices of California project](http://web.stanford.edu/dept/linguistics/VoCal/index.html) is a multi-year dialect
survey of non-urban speech throughout California. From 2017 until its pandemic-induced hiatus in 2019, I served as a
fieldworker interviewing and recruiting participants. When not performing fieldwork, I have contributed to the analysis of
data and the construction of the corpus.

### The low back merger in California English
My second qualifying paper used the data from five field sites to revisit the claim that Californians have a merger in 
production between the LOT and THOUGHT vowels. Better known as the cot-caught merger, previous work has found significant overlap in
formant frequencies among Californians, but work on other mergers across North America has found that vowel classes which appear
to have merged along the first and second formants may still differ on a third dimension such as dynamism, length, or vowel quality.
Using the Voices of California data, I replicated previous findings of convergence in first and second formants, developed a novel
method to anaylze whether the formant trajectories of the vowels were converging in both formants simultaneously, and analyzed
whether the vowel classes were diverging in length. The paper, in preparation to be submitted, presents evidence that while the 
formants of the vowels are converging over apparent time, they are simultaneously diverging in length suggesting that our previous 
claims of merger should be revisted with more scrutiny.

### Indexicality of variation in Latinx Californians
With other members of the Voices of California project, we analyzed how Latinx speakers in our sample use aspects of the 
California Vowel Shift to construct identity and convey social meaning. At the 2020 Meeting of the American Dialect Society, 
I presented joint work investigating how the phonetic and phonological patterning of the TRAP vowel is used by Latinx Salinas 
speakers to index their orientation towards town or country ideologies (in many ways similar to Paul Reed's "rootedness"). Among 
white Californians, TRAP shows a pronounced nasal split, where the vowel is raised before nasals and backed elsewhere. The backing 
pattern is seen amon Latinx Californians in our data, but the nasal split is less common. Our data show that among Latinx speakers, 
more "country" oriented speakers show a smaller difference between prenasal and non-nasal low-front vowels. This finding is the reverse 
of what has been foud among white speakers. We argue that this pattern shows that depending on the particular social landscape a 
language is enbedded within, the same change can acquire different indexical values.

### Where's the line between NorCal and SoCal?
As part of our interview process, participants are given a map of California and asked to draw lines indicating where they think
the major divisions are in the state. In most cases, participants divide the state into Northern and Southern section, and sometimes
include a "Central" section. With other project members and help from the Stanford Geology Library staff, I documented a workflow
for the digitization of these and future maps so that we can analyze them in a geographic information system (GIS). Using GIS software
we are able to analyze how conceptions of NorCal and SoCal vary across the state. Based on visual impressions so far, participants 
tend to draw the dividing line close to where they live. For speakers in southern California, they tend to place the line north of 
themselves, while speakers in northern California tend to draw the line just south of themselves. The GIS software also produces some
[nice looking maps](http://web.stanford.edu/~ctb77/AllFieldsitesMap.png).

## Ende
Ende (ISO 639: `kit`) is a Pahoturi River language spoken in southwestern Papua New Guinea. To the field's detriment, many of our 
sociolinguistic theories of language change are not robustly tested on data from understudied languages. Along with Kate Lindsey and
other field workers in the area, I have started a number of projects using their data to investigate changes in Ende and its 
relationship to its sprachbund neighbors. Most recently I have been helping with a comparative analysis of the Pahoturi River 
languages to better understand their historical relationship to each other and hopefully their connection to other language families.

My main work has been on invetigating a pattern of nasal elision in an Ende copula which is socially patterned and potentially a 
change in progress. Like in California's low-back vowels, it is not clear whether a distinction was lost or whether it has moved 
to a different dimension. Our work so far has been investigating the quality of the nasal consonant and whether the change 
represents a categorical loss or a phonetic reduction. Using acoustic measurments as articulatory proxies we find evidence that 
suggests the tongue-tip gesture in /n/ is not lost, but reduced. Further work will examine the velar gesture and the quality of 
the preceding vowel to determine whether the vowel is becoming nasalized due to the consonant weakening.

## Social dynamics of wikis
As part of [my contributions to free culture](../about/free-culture.md) I study the communities and organizations in which I 
participate with the goal of applying my findings to the problems we face. My work in this area tends to focus on how internet
communities function and the social dynamics that constrain how they grow and change. At the 2021 Wikimania, a global conference
for wiki editors, I presented the results of my research on page protection and motivated a theory of how wikis respond to 
rapid growth.
