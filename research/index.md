## Voices of California
A major part of my work involved data collected during field work With the Stanford 
[Voices of California project](http://web.stanford.edu/dept/linguistics/VoCal/index.html), which interviews English speakers across
the state anually and represents one of the largest and most geographically diverse data sets of California English. I have 
conducted interviews at the three most recent field sites: Humboldt County, Redlands, and Amador County. My chief interest in this 
work is to understand how language is changing across the state, particularly with regards to measures not frequently studied in the
existing literature.

My second qualifying paper used the data from the five field sites to challenge the claim that Californians have a merger in 
production between the LOT and THOUGHT vowels. Better known as the cot-caught merger, previous work has found significant overlap in
formant frequencies among Californians, but work on other mergers across North America has found that vowel classes which appear
to have merged along the first and second formants may still differ on a third dimension such as dynamism, length, or vowel quality.
Using the Voices of California data, I replicated previous findings of convergence in first and second formants, developed a novel
method to anaylze whether the formant trajectories of the vowels were converging in both formants simultaneously, and analyzed
whether the vowel classes were diverging in length. The paper, in preparation to be submitted, presents evidence that while the 
formants of the vowels are converging over apparent time, they are simultaneously diverging in length suggesting that our previous 
claims of merger should be revisted with more scrutiny.

Alongside my colleagues, I also use the data to investigate how these changes are used by speakers to construct an identity and 
convey social meaning. At the 2020 Meeting of the American Dialect Society, I presented joint work investigating how the phonetic 
and phonological patterning of the TRAP vowel is used by Latinx Salinas speakers to index their orientation towards town or country 
ideologies (in many ways similar to Paul Reed's "rootedness"). Among white Californians, TRAP shows a pronounced nasal split, where
the vowel is raised before nasals and backed elsewhere. The backing pattern is seen amon Latinx Californians in our data, but the 
nasal split is less common. Our data show that among Latinx speakers, more "country" oriented speakers show a smaller difference 
between prenasal and non-nasal low-front vowels. This finding is the reverse of what has been foud among white speakers, and shows 
that depending on the particular social landscape a language is enbedded within, the same change can acquire different social 
patterns.

I have contributed to this project in other, often more technical, capacities. As of 2020, I am working with Lily Clifford to improve
our corpus management infrastructure. As part of my update to FAVE, I am also planning to create an automated data pipeline for the 
alignment of the corpus and its metadata which I hope will be generalizable to other sociolinguistic corpora. As part of the interview, participants draw on a map to indicate what regions they see California divided into, and to digitize and analyze this data I 
have helped design and document a geographic information system (GIS) workflow. Much of this work comes out of ad hoc scripts I wrote
in the course of working with the data, and so I view this cycle of development helpful not only for making my own work easier in 
the future, but improving the usability of the corpus for everyone.

## Ende
Ende (ISO 639: `kit`) is a Pahoturi River language spoken in southwestern Papua New Guinea. To the field's detriment, many of our 
sociolinguistic theories of language change are not robustly tested on data from understudied languages. Along with Kate Lindsey and
other field workers in the area, I have started a number of projects using their data to investigate changes in Ende and its 
relationship to its sprachbund neighbors. Most recently I have been helping with a comparative analysis of the Pahoturi River 
languages to better understand their historical relationship to each other and hopefully their connection to other language families.

My main work has been on invetigating a pattern of nasal elision in an Ende copula which is socially patterned and potentially a 
change in progress. Like in California's low-back vowels, it is not clear whether a distinction was lost or whether it has moved 
to a different dimension. Our work so far has been investigating the quality of the nasal consonant and whether the change 
represents a categorical loss or a phonetic reduction. Using acoustic measurments as articulatory proxies we find evidence that 
suggests the tongue-tip gesture in /n/ is not lost, but reduced. Further work will examine the velar gesture and the quality of 
the preceding vowel to determine whether the vowel is becoming nasalized due to the consonant weakening.
