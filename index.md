Hello! I'm Christian Brickhouse.

I like making cool stuff. My specialties are human subjects experiments and writing software. 

Some cool stuff I work on:
- An inventory management platform for Pokemon card sellers to learn Django and PostgreSQL and also to keep track of my Pokemon card collection
- A framework for controlling the rumble packs of a PS4 controller during experiments to study the effect of haptic feedback on language processing
- A diarization and transcription preprocessor for a suite of acoustic analysis software to learn about ML integrations
- A full stack widget for Wikipedia to deliver interactive chess games

And it's all freely licensed and open source!

You should take a [look at my résumé](/cv/resume)
