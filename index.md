Hello! I'm CJ Brickhouse. Welcome to my personal website where I occasionally post updates on my latest projects.

In my professional life, I'm the Chess Program Manager at the Mechanics' Institute Chess Club. Founded in 1954, the Mechanics' Institute is the oldest continually operating Chess Club in North America, and I manage our outreach efforts to schools across San Francisco. The views on my personal website are my own and do not represent the views of my employer.

# One page RPGs
A series of one (web)page role playing games that I make when the mood strikes me.
1. [Instruct for Canada]({{site.baseurl}}/games/01-instruct-for-canada.html)
2. [Block, Capture, Attack]({{site.baseurl}}/games/02-block-capture-run-away.html)

# Language variation and change
1. Changes in California Vowels ([Master's Thesis]({{site.baseurl}}/research/preprints/Brickhouse2020_CaliVowelContrastMaintenance_QP2.pdf))
2. Language change in Papua New Guinea ([Conference Paper]({{site.baseurl}}/research/preprints/Brickhouse%26Lindsey2021_APLLHandout.pdf))

# Other stuff
- Wikipedia: I'm a Wikipedian and have had at least 7 articles featured on the front page. I also do back room work and community organizing. Ask me about it in person as I try not to connect the two online.
- Gaming: I like playing a lot of different games though working at a chess club that tends to be my main game. Others include go, Pokemon (TCG and VGC), Blood on the Clocktower, Wingspan, Dungeons and Dragons, and Dominion to name just a few favorites.
