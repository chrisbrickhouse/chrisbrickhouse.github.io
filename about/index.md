title: About me
---
As of 2021, I am a PhD candidate in Linguistics at Stanford University with a focus on sociophonetics. In general I am 
interested in how our theories of lexical access can accomodate theories of socially-mediated sound change. My in-progress 
dissertation work is investigating part of this question: do the linguistic memories we use to recognize speech include 
haptic context and are the effects consistent with sociolinguistic theories of embodiment. [My research page](../research)
has more extensive information on my academic work, so this page covers the not-so-academic stuff I find enjoyable in my 
free time.

My hobbies tend to center around the [free culture movement](free-culture.md) which incorporates free software and 
free knowledge. I believe our contributions to human knowledge should be accesible to all, and that our technological 
achievements should guarantee the right for others to distribute and build upon our work. I also just like to code. My 
software contributions are covered [on the software page](../software/index.md) and my broader contributions are covered
[on the free culture page](free-culture.md).

For fun, I can usually be found playing chess or tinkering with electronics. I'm a member of the United States Chess 
Federation, though I am unrated in over-the-board play given limited opportunities during the pandemic. I also build and
repair electronics. If you see a nest of wires or circuit boards behind me, it's likely I'm in the middle of a project 
such as refurbishing broken nintendo consoles or modding my Playstation so that it connects to LED light strips. I have 
many other interests, but as of writing these are the two I'm working on most.
