title: About me
---
As of 2020, I am a PhD candidate in Linguistics at Stanford University with a focus on sociophonetics. In general I am 
interested in how our phonetic theories can predict and explain sociolinguistic patterns. More specifically, I am interested
in whether post-structuralist and third wave theories of sociolinguistics can be incorporated into the exemplar model, and
if doing so improves our ability to explain and predict the course of linguistic change. My in progress dissertation work
is investigating part of this question: does the linguistic faculty have access to the somatosensory information stored in 
exemplars and if so can experimental manipulation of these paralinguistic cues precipitate linguistic changes in production
or perception. However, other parts of this website have more extensive information on my academic work, so this page 
covers the not-so-academic stuff I find enjoyable in my free time.

Beyond my academic work, I have a number of hobbies which tend to center around the free software and free knowledge 
movements. I believe our contributions to human knowledge should be accesible to all, and that our technological 
achievements should guarantee the right for others to distribute and build upon our work. I also just like to code.
As such, I contribute to a number of projects with linguistic and non-linguistic topics. I rewrote the Force Alignment 
and Vowe Extraction (FAVE) toolkit, a popular tool in sociolinguistic work, so that it uses the modern Python 3, 
can be better incorporated into external scripts, and automatically documents itself. I've contributed code to MediaWiki,
the software that runs Wikipedia, and since I like chess, I currently lead a project to extend the software so that it can
parse and display chess games from PGN files. Most of my code is licensed under a Gnu General Public License, especially 
innovative work, because it ensures others not only have the right to modify and redistribute the code, but that all 
derivative works must guarantee the same rights to others. If you haven't looked into the GPL, I recommend you read about 
it and consider releasing your work under its terms.

I also volunteer on the English Wikipedia, and have worked with Gretchen McCulloch and others to introduce academics
to the process of contributing to Wikipedia. You may have seen us at a Linguistic Society Annual Meeting hosting an 
edit-a-thon, and if you haven't, stop by the next one! With expertise and access to a wide array of sources, academics are
in a unique position to help Wikipedia editors. Much of what I do isn't even writing articles, but providing sources for 
those [citation needed] tags, fixing typos, or leaving comments on the talk page to note what topics still need to be 
covered. Plus the people are friendly and care about sharing knowledge with others. If you're interested in volunteering,
get in touch and I'll help you out!
