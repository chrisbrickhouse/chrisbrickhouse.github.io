title: About me
---
I have a variety of interests, and I tend to cycle among them:
- I like playing chess, and prefer over-the-board to online. My rating from FIDE is about 1600. You can check out some of [my best games](https://lichess.org/study/MrxGWiNC) alongside my commentary. If you don't know much about chess, [this profile of me in the *SF Chronicle*](https://www.sfchronicle.com/sf/article/downtown-san-francisco-chess-17384813.php)  will give you a sense of what it's like to talk to me.
- I'm a visual artist and I've led maker spaces focused on theatrical production, photography, wood work, and moveable type printing. One of my favorite examples is my 2016 production of *Julius Caesar* where I was director and tech lead. My artistic choices to gender reverse that cast and set the piece during the 1920s Progressive Era led was lauded as ["a rare commodity in the vast collection of Shakespeare performances"](https://cornellsun.com/2016/03/16/risley-theatres-julius-caesar-a-unique-and-compelling-adaptation/).
- I like table top games of all kinds. My favorite board game is Wingspan because it strikes a good balance for casual and expert players. Also it has birds. My favorite table-top RPG is Mouse Guard which is built on the Burning Wheel system. I've been branching out from d20 systems like Dungeons and Dragons, and I really like the control Mouse Guard/Burning Wheel gives GMs over probability distributions. Also it has mice. My favorite card game is Pokemon where my main decks are built around bird pokemon and mouse pokemon.
- I really like pigeons and my opinions on that will not fit on this page.
