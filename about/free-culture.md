title: Free culture and us
---
The ability to collaborate and build upon previous work is fundamental to the development of human knowledge and 
technology. Much of the work I do would be impossible without robust freedoms to read, experiment, and tell others 
about what I found. To protect these freedoms and ensure that others have the same rights, I participate in the 
free culture movement both inside and outside academia. As an example, you'll see a lot of my work available under
licenses such as the Gnu General Public License (GPL) and the Creative Commons ShareAlike (CC-SA) licenses which 
guarantee that others can make the most use of it for whatever purposes they need.

Free culture includes [free software](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.en.html#four-freedoms), and as a developer 
I contribute to a number of projects with linguistic and non-linguistic topics. I am working to port the Force Alignment 
and Vowe Extraction (FAVE) toolkit to Python 3 and package it for distribution through the Python Package Index. FAVE is 
a popular tool in sociolinguistic work, so keeping it working is important for reproducing previous work and maintaining 
workflows in particular labs. It is also published under a GPL which allows me to make these changes and distribute them 
to my colleagues for testing even before they get accepted into the main program. I've likewise contributed code to 
MediaWiki, the software that runs Wikipedia, and I currently lead a project to extend the software so that Wikipedia and 
other wikis can create interactive chess content on articles and pages. By participating in this project, I'm not only 
helping improve the experience of millions of readers, I ensure that the code can be reused and maintained in my absence. 
The ability to join and work on the MediaWiki software has also taught me about writing production-quality code, and 
because of the free culture I had that opportunity.

Much of my free time is spent volunteering on the English Wikipedia. In that role I have created or expanded articles 
on linguistics topics such as Phonetics, Electromagnetic Articulography, and the Linguistics Society of America. I have 
written a number of articles which have been evaluated by the community as featured articles including 
Black American Sign Language which was featured on the front page as Today's Featured Article for November 18, 2016. In 
light of my content work and other contributions I was 
[elected an administrator in January 2020](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_adminship/Wugapodes). In 
August 2021 I was named to the Wikimedia Foundation regional grants committee which oversees the disbursment of funds to 
organizations and individuals in the United States and Canada such as the Wiki Loves Monuments photo competition or 
funding outreach events at universities and libraries.

I also work to bring more linguists and subject experts into the editorial community as content on indiginous langauges and 
theoretical topics can be hard to write about for those without domain knowledge. With Gretchen McCulloch and others, I 
have helped organize and provide technical support to #LingWiki events such as the 2019 Year of Indigenous Languages series 
of edit-a-thons. As part of #LingWiki I have helped organize an annual edit-a-thon at the Linguistic Society of America 
Annual Meeeting, and I have provided support to edit-a-thons organized by the Committee on Gender Equity in Linguistics 
and teh Committee on LGBTQ+ Issues in Linguistics. If you've been to an edit-a-thon on linguistics topics, you've probably 
met me! And if you haven't stop by the next one and say hi! 

With expertise and access to a wide array of sources, academics are in a unique position to help Wikipedia editors. Much 
of what I do isn't even writing articles, but providing sources for those [citation needed] tags, fixing typos, or leaving 
comments on the talk page to note what topics still need to be covered. Plus the people are friendly and care about sharing 
knowledge with others. If you're interested in volunteering, 
[get in touch on my talk page](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Wugapodes&action=edit&section=new&preloadtitle=Question%20from%20%7B%7Bsubst%3Acurrentuser%7D%7D) 
and I'll help you out! You may also find 
[my quick start guide for linguists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Wugapodes/Linguistics_quick_start) useful too.
