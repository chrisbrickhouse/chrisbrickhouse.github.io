title: Free culture and us
---
I believe that humans are driven to use, study, tinker, and share. I believe it is essential that all humans have the right to satisfy these needs, and my belief leads me to support the free culture movement. Most of my work is available under a Creative Commons license or a permissive software license. You can even edit this website if you really want to!

My free software advocacy has led me to some interesting places. I made Wikipedia's 20th anniversary logo. I presented to the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights on behalf of the Wikimedia Foundation. I disberse $2 million annually in grants to mission aligned non-profits. I've been elected to two offices in the Wikipedia community, one of which *Slate* describes as Wikipedia's "Supreme Court". These are my highlights, but what makes them meaningful is the opportunity I had to advocate for greater and safer access to the sum total of human knowledge for all of humanity.
