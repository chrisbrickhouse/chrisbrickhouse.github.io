I like games and in my spare time I make them. The current series I'm working on are one (web)page RPGs that are relatively simple single player RPGs. The main design constraint is that everything has to fit in one file (one page) that can be shared and run without dependencies or internet.

1. [Instruct for Canada]({{site.baseurl}}/games/01-instruct-for-canada.html)
2. [Block, Capture, Attack]({{site.baseurl}}/games/02-block-capture-run-away.html)
